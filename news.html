                        <p>Recoshelf is a Retailtech startup that develops solutions to automate in-store operations,
                            specifically
                            inventory. These solutions make use of cameras, computer vision, and artificial intelligence
                            to scan the
                            shelves of products and provide real-time reports about product availability, planogram, and
                            prices.</p>
                            
                        <p>Based on the data collected, store staff can be automatically notified about restocking
                            requirements
                            promptly. Thus, our mission resonates well with the needs and trends of the modern world for
                            digitization.
                        </p>
                        <p>Recoshelf ideally intends to free store personnel from their routine work and help improve
                            the overall
                            efficiency of retail practices. Therefore, our ultimate goal is to cut operating costs,
                            improve consumers’
                            loyalty and safety, give retail and FMCG managers better control over the shelves, make
                            shelf functioning
                            more visible, decrease waste, and improve the experience of consumers.

                            <h4>USF grant program application</h4>
                            <p>Startups burn through capital, especially machine-learning startups. At Recoshelf, we
                                were
                                looking for
                                money
                                to invest in our camera assistant software startup project. It appeared more complex
                                than
                                we’d initially
                                thought.</p>
                            <p>As per the usual financial projections for startups, our angel investment fund did
                                not cover
                                our growing
                                expenses. This led to us applying for a local Ukrainian Startup Fund call. This fund
                                invests
                                $25k to
                                pre-seed and $50k to seed-stage companies.</p>
                            <p>For us, it was a great opportunity as this fund does not take equity, stated Yaroslav
                                Parkhisenko, CEO of
                                Recoshelf. This is especially important as the dilution of the founder’s share at
                                such an
                                early stage may
                                negatively influence future rounds of investments.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, it took 4 months to prepare a quality application to pitch. We also hired
                                three
                                team members
                                for
                                our Machine Learning project and needed more cash, commented Mykyta Holubakha, CTO.
                            </p>
                            <p>At the National pitch of tech startups ideas that took place on November 27, we met
                                other
                                professionals
                                that
                                owns several startup pages, and really enjoyed the other innovative pitches,
                                especially the
                                IoT ideas.
                                When
                                it came to the questions to ask before investing in a startup, the judges drew our
                                attention
                                to our
                                shortcomings and indicated areas for improvement.</p>
                            <p>This was an eye-opener for us. Such events not only provide great investment
                                opportunities
                                but also allow
                                for networking and establishing useful connections.</p>
                            <h4>About Recoshelf Technology</h4>
                            <p>The recent progress in IoT and neural networks, the big success of Amazon Go, and
                                robotized
                                warehouses
                                have
                                pushed retail to digitization. Nevertheless, the Coronavirus pandemic has further
                                accelerated this
                                transformation that powers IoT majorly due to human impact, contact limitation, and
                                wage
                                increase issues.
                            </p>
                            <p>Hence, we at Recoshelf believe that we are offering our automation solution to the
                                market at
                                the right
                                time.
                                We skillfully install computer vision solutions that utilize IoT cameras to monitor
                                the
                                products in a
                                fully
                                automated manner. Data is then interpreted with the use of convolutional neural
                                networks and
                                computer
                                vision.</p>
                            <p>We also provide numerous benefits like high flexibility, short rollout time, and low
                                power
                                mode camera, a
                                low resolution that is still good enough for high detection accuracy.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, our solution has zero to low CAPEX investment requirements for
                                implementation
                                in view of
                                not
                                only the above advantages but also our marketing approach. We have an API that an
                                IoT
                                engineer can easily
                                integrate into an existing ERP system of retailers to utilize our data in warehouse
                                management, automatic
                                pre-ordering, or other subsystems.</p>
